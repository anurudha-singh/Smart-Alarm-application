## Current Limitations

**Android**
- All scenarios (**foreground**, **background**, and **terminated**) function correctly with full ringing screen and snooze/stop actions.


**iOS**
- **Foreground**: Alarms work correctly with full ringing screen (Stop/Snooze).  
- **Background**: Currently limited to vibration only. The ringing screen appears once the app is reopened.  
- **Terminated (Killed State)**: Behavior still under verification. Requires IPA build testing.  

## Snooze test case is included.
